# A simple CRUD React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

I created this project to apply what I have learned during my classes.

Libraries used:
ExpressJS
Material UI
React Router

## To run

Server/Backend
`cd react_api` 
`npm install`
`npm run watch`

User Interface/Frontend
`cd react_app`
`npm install`
`npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
